<h1>CBT Toys</h1>
<p>If you've visited my homepage, you probably know that CBT isn't 
exactly up my alley. However, a number of folks have asked about this 
type of toy, and if this is your thing, it's a great opportunity to save
 some bucks. Most SM shops carry a bewildering array of little leather 
items related to this pursuit, and want to charge $10-25 for things that
 cost a couple of dollars to make yourself. </p>
<p>With this in mind, I have put together a number of brief plans for 
items useful in CBT. None of these are difficult, although sizing may 
vary based on your relative, er, size (and desired tightness). This page
 assumes that you know how to measure, cut, punch, etc., and the plans 
have notes instead of detailed steps. Enjoy. </p>
<p>Note: The word 'tool' in project descriptions on this page replaces 
the 'C' in CBT. Apologies for any confusion this may cause, but Working 
with Leather will remain in compliance with AOL Terms-of-Service. </p>
<h2>Difficulty: Easy</h2>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Mallet, Utility Knife, Rivet Setter, Punch, 1" Oblong Punch, Edge 
Beveler #2, Edge Slicker, Strap-Cutter (optional), Durable Dot Setter 
and Anvil (optional), Eyelet Setter (optional) </p>
<h2>Supplies (sorry, no Checklists!)</h2>
<p>10 oz Latigo Leather or lighter Garment Leather, .5" Roller Buckles, .5" D-rings, Medium Rivets, Edge Coat, Eyelets (optional) </p>
<h2>Basic Ball Stretcher</h2>
<p>The basic ball stretcher is simply a small strap with some snaps 
(durable dots) to close it. You can also use buckles, if you prefer. In 
the diagram below, the snap tops are on the left and bases on the right.
 The bottom portion of the diagram adds two hanging straps terminating 
in D-rings. This configuration can be used to attach weights to the rig.

<h2>Stretcher with Divider</h2>
<p>The plan below also uses a couple of straps, and fastens with snaps. 
The top horizontal strap goes around the base of both tool and balls, 
the second horizontal strap goes around the ball sack, and the vertical 
strap divides the balls by snapping back to the ball strap. A small 
D-ring in the center of the vertical strap allows the attachment of 
weights, leash, or the feet. </p>

<h2>Leather Gates of Hell</h2>
<p>The simplest version of the Gates of Hell is a series of leather 
straps that snap up the length of the tool. The long (top) strap goes 
around the base of both tool and balls, and the remaining horizontal 
straps snap around the tool. You can change the number of, and distance 
between, the tools straps to suit your fancy. </p>

<h2>The Real Gates of Hell</h2>
<p>Of course, a real Gates of Hell isn't a set of wimpy leather strips! 
It is hefty metal O-rings! This, too, is a simple thing to make. The 
vertical strap in the diagram below buckles around the base of tool and 
balls. The remaining straps hold metal O-rings in place up the tool. You
 can use as many rings as desired, and these can be of decreasing 
diameter. </p>

<h2>Standard Parachute</h2>
<p>The standard parachute, used to stretch the balls by hanging weights 
on them, is pictured below. The three points marked 'Grommeted Holes' 
are points to secure light chain. Get three 5" lengths of chain, cut the
 last link, and put that link of each chain through the indicated holes.
 Clamp it tight with vice-grips. Do the same thing to the other end of 
each chain and clamp each around on O-ring. Hangs weights from said 
O-ring. </p>

<h2>Parachute with Pull</h2>
<p>Another version of a parachute foregoes the chain, replacing it with a
 leather pull. This diagram shows a buckling closure instead of snaps, 
but either works. Weights are tied to the D-ring in the indicated 
location. </p>
